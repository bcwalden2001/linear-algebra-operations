This program manually implements core linear-algebra algorithms and runs them on example matrices.

## Summary

The file defines custom functions for Gauss-Jordan elimination, Gaussian elimination with back-substitution, matrix inversion, and matrix determinant calculation.
All of which are coded from scratch without NumPy math. The main function loads several test matrices, runs each algorithm, and prints the resulting solution vectors, inverse matrix, and determinant.
