## Summary

The file defines custom functions for:
    -Gauss-Jordan elimination
    -Gaussian elimination with back-substitution
    -Matrix inversion 
    -Matrix determinant

The main function loads several test matrices, runs each algorithm, and prints the solution vectors, inverse matrices, and determinants.
